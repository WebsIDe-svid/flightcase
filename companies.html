            <p>
                You hear about the possibilities we have to offer, and you are keen on starting a conversation with
                us. Then, we will be more than happy to think along with you on the content and deliverables of
                the project.<br><br>

                Making it a collaborative journey will benefit both your company and our designers, who will be
                working for you in these valuable cases.

                The case definition states what challenge or challenges you would like us to work in; we will support
                you in shaping and writing this brief.<br><br>

                Cases can be in the direction of strategic development, concept design, service development, product
                creation or anything else that you and your company consider worthwhile, no matter how challenging
                it is. We are also willing to participate in large issues such as organization transitions,
                regulatory manifestos or city-scopes. Do not hesitate to go wild.

            <h3>3. Research and preparation</h3>
            <p>
                In April, our students and professors will start preparing for the cases by analyzing the current
                situation of your business and the context of the topic. Stakeholders will be defined, and we will
                explore the domain and trends. On top of that, we will sharpen our skills to adequately solve these
                cases.<br><br>

                This process will be facilitated with customized workshops and lectures that help our designers to
                gain knowledge about the topic. As the case progresses, we will keep you up to date by sending status
                reports on a regular basis.

            <p>
                The aim of the Flight Case team is to travel to Japan for 3 weeks in July/August 2025. During our stay,
                we will visit your company to introduce our research, continue developing the solutions further and
                eventually present the deliverables.<br><br>

                During the case days, there is room for exploring possibilities with the designers on a more personal
                level and expanding your and your employee's networks. The professors are leading actors in the
                industry, and they are always eager to collaborate and share their knowledge with you. By the same
                token, many students are close to graduation, and they would love to hear what your company has to
                offer.

            <p>
                After the visit, we will provide your company with the final reports that will contain the outcomes
                of the work that has been done. Besides, we will share the results with other professors and students
                at the TU Delft, raising exposure of your company and the program.<br><br>

                Ultimately, as part of the final stage, a reflection in which we ask you for your experiences will
                be needed. In doing so, we will be able to improve our program in the future.
