            <h2>Your next adventure</h2>
            <p>
                During this summer, 28 master students and 2 professors will go to Japan to work on cases for inspiring
                companies, experience the local culture and much more!<br><br>

                The aim of Flight Case is to create an experience that connects an international team of qualified
                master students with leading companies all over the world. It will allow you as a student to build
                up an international network and experience working in another culture.<br><br>

                We will 'work hard', but also 'play hard'. We want to show you the contrasts: city vs. nature, the
                global vs. the local, and more. We aim to provide you with an experience you will never forget!<br><br>
