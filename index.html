            <h3>Solutions that spark innovation</h3>
            <p>
                Every company must invest in its own future through innovation in order to stay ahead of the
                competition, which sometimes can be challenging. Flight Case helps your company to come up with
                fresh ideas and innovative solutions.<br><br>

                Young designers still have the mindset of thinking in a wide range of possibilities,
                rather than restrictions and energize the company with our youthful enthusiasm.
                Consequently, it is a common positive side-effect that the employees are more involved and
                happier after working with us.

            <h3>Long-lasting connections</h3>
            <p>
                Working together with designers from Delft University of Technology can provide you with long-lasting
                connections that hold promise for many possibilities in the future. Many students are close to
                finishing their masters and are exploring their graduation options, future work environments,
                new research fields or open positions.<br><br>

                Likewise, this can become a showroom for your company as students, professors and alumni, hear
                from you and can be triggered by the possibilities you offer; not only through real-life experience,
                yet by the stories that are shared after the trip with their network too.

            <h3>Famous design methodologies</h3>
            <p>
                Our designers have a dual approach to problem-solving rooted in analytical and creative methods.
                We are able to work with and share the acclaimed Vision in Product Design method and the Delft
                Innovation Model among many other processes that can benefit your company. These theories have
                proven their value over time, resulting in trustworthy tools that create impactful solutions.

                <p>
                    Compared to large and expensive design agencies, Flight Case is a low-investment and a
                    low-risk alternative whose deliveries are grounded in the same methods. Even though we
                    might have less experience, we compensate it by holding fewer prejudices against the
                    business world and, thus, coming up with more out-of-the-box ideas.

                <p>
                    People are often fond of the way designers analyze and solve problems, which makes us be a
                    great asset for innovation. Creativity is a virtue that has just gained traction and leading
                    companies around the world are starting to hire designers and use their mindset to solve
                    their business problems with unconventional and imaginative ideas.

                    Our group consists of young designers from all over the world. We believe that diversity
                    enriches the insights in a project and creates a future-proof concept in this globalized
                    and intertwined economy. Moreover, it is an enormous opportunity to work with people with
                    different backgrounds and to get to know foreign cultures.
